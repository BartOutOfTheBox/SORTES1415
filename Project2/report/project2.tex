\section{User guide \label{sec:userguide}}
When the board is started up, it will act as a DHCP relay agent. More information about DHCP, and DHCP relay agents can be found on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol} {\textbf{Wikipedia}}.

\subsection{Relay Agent configuration}
This relay agent has a static IP address (\textit{192.168.97.60/24}), and is configured to be able to work in the \textit{192.168.97.0/24} subnet. The relay agent itself is preconfigured and should work out of the box once the router and DHCP server are configured as below.

\subsection{DHCP Server configuration}
In order for this relay agent to work, the user needs to set up his own DHCP server. This server should be located in the \textit{192.168.96.0/24} subnet, with \textit{192.168.96.2/24} as ip address. These settings are hardcoded, and can be changed in Main.h if necessary. The server needs to be configured to be able to give out ip addresses in the subnet of the relay agent (\textit{192.168.97.60/24}). The relay agent will now relay DHCP messages from his subnet to the DHCP server.

\subsection{Router configuration}
The router between the two networks should have the NAT feature disabled.

\section{System Engineer guide}
\subsection{Compile}
To compile the program, simply type \textbf{\textit{make DHCPRelay}} while in the source root.

\subsection{Upload to Pic}
To upload the program to the pic, upload \textbf{\textit{main.hex}} using tftp as described in \href{http://www.foditic.org/SORTES\_14/missions/picUnixE.php}{\textbf{PIC development in C on UNIX howto}}.

\subsection{Tests}
To test the board, you can enable a DHCP client in the subnet of the DHCP relay agent. This client should now be assigned an IP address by the DHCP server.\\

The following tests have been run to confirm the correct working of the agent:
\begin{itemize}
\item A single PC connecting to the network and requesting a new IP
\item Multiple PC's connecting to the network at the same time and requesting a new IP
\item A PC with a static IP connecting to the network
\item A PC reconnecting to the network and requesting their old IP
\item A PC connected to the network for a longer period of time and renewing its lease
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Decisions}

The code of this relay agent was produced by translating ASG diagrams \ref{fig:asg} and \ref{fig:asgRelaying} to C.
As described in the ASG diagram, the relay agent has two components. One component receives ip packages, the other component sends ip packages. TODO VERDERE UITLEG

\end{figure}

\subsection{Seperate Client/Server components}

\subsection{Seperate Receive/Process components}

\subsection{Buffer size}
The internal buffers from which the processing-components of the application consume and for which the receiving-components of the application produce dhcp packages, have a size of one. This means that each pair of components (receiver-processor) of the application are tightly coupled. The consumer component has to consume the last packet before the producer can produce a new one. This limitation makes sure there is enough memory on the processor to hold the buffer. While this may seem like a heavy limitation, it is really not. The TCP/IP stack implementation provided does also work with only one packet.\\
Given enough memory, this buffer could easily be extended to contain more than one message. This would not affect the workings of the components
